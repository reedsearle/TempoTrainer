# TempoTrainer
Visual tempo training tool for musicians
author:  Reed Searle
Date:  13 april 2022

This tool allows musicians to plug in an instrument/microphone and use the onboard metronome to see how close to the beat they are.  A green flash mean they are on the beat, a blue flash means they are ahead of the beat and a red flash means they are behind the beat.  The relative distance away from the beat is seen on the neopixel ring
